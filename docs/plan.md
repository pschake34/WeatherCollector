# Plan For WeatherCollector

Natural phenomena have long fascinated humanity with their unpredictability and beauty. Our project would endeavor to bring order to the chaos of weather events by recording data on temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speeds, rain amounts, and possibly even air quality and clouds. This data would then be conglomerated in a web dashboard for ease of viewing. 

### Smart Goal

We will create a weather station with at least 4 sensors and a web dashboard. We will work on this during class, and on our own for at least 6 hours a week, finishing by February 1, 2021.

### Criteria
* 4 or 5 sensors
* Windmill
* Data collected by arduino
* Web dashboard
* Data sent wirelessly from Arduino

### Constraints

**Time:** Feb 1st

**Budget:** $100

**Safety:** Spinning blades will need to be given attention to, especially making sure that other students not involved with the project won’t be able to hurt themselves or the machinery. Spinning blades and high voltage will be brought into the project last so that fewer mishaps have the opportunity to occur.

**Location:** Where to put the project

### Needed proof of concepts

* Each sensor working individually
* Connect MKR 1010 to WiFi
* Get initial website working on hosting provider
* Get communication between MKR and initial website working

### Design sketches and images

In Progress...

### List of materials

photo interrupter, arduino, thermometer, hygrometer, barometer, anemometer, rainfall detection system

### What we don’t know

How to program each individual sensor, what kind of communication protocol each sensor uses, what kind of hosting we will use for the website (maybe something onsite?), how to communicate between the arduino and the web server.

### Schedule & delegation of work/accountability

**Paul:** Writing code + wiring + electronics

**Ezhar:** CAD + assembly + testing + weatherproofing
