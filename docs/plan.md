# Plan For WeatherCollector

Natural phenomena have long fascinated humanity with their unpredictability and beauty. Our project would endeavor to bring order to the chaos of weather events by recording data on temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speeds, rain amounts, and possibly even air quality and clouds. This data would then be conglomerated in a web dashboard for ease of viewing. 

### Smart Goal

We will create a weather station with at least 4 sensors and a web dashboard. We will work on this during class, and on our own for at least 6 hours a week, finishing by February 1, 2021.

### Criteria
* 4 or 5 sensors
* Windmill
* Data collected by arduino
* Web dashboard
* Data sent wirelessly from Arduino

### Constraints

**Time:** Feb 1st

**Budget:** $100

**Safety:** Spinning blades will need to be given attention to, especially making sure that other students not involved with the project won’t be able to hurt themselves or the machinery. Spinning blades and high voltage will be brought into the project last so that fewer mishaps have the opportunity to occur.

**Location:** Where to put the project

### Needed proof of concepts

Get each sensor working individually, prototype of communication between web server and arduino with simple initial website design

### Design sketches and images

Will have a wind gauge that measures the wind speed and displays it on the dashboard.  Will also have a barometric pressure sensor to measure air pressure. Will also have a thermometer to measure temperature. Will have a photo interrupter to measure how many times the blades spin per minute. Will also have a 

### List of materials

photo interrupter, arduino, thermometer, hygrometer, barometer, anemometer 

### What we don’t know

How to program each individual sensor, what kind of communication protocol each sensor uses, what kind of hosting we will use for the website (maybe something onsite?), how to communicate between the arduino and the web server.



### Schedule & delegation of work/accountability

**Paul:** Writing code + wiring + electronics

**Ezhar:** CAD + assembly + testing
